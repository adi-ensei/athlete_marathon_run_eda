1. **Data Import and Initial Inspection**
   - Importing necessary libraries.
   - Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
   - Showing the shape and data types of the dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Filtering the dataset to include only specific race conditions (e.g., races in the USA, 50km or 50mi distances, and from the year 2020).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing various aspects of the dataset using `seaborn`.
